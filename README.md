For this user research I will be conducting an interview that is primarily participant observation. We will be meeting up in the library at a study room I had reserved ahead of time. This allows for a distraction-free environment where the user is able to perform day to day tasks and I can interact with them more clearly. While conducting this interview I will be mainly watching for how a college student tackles issues such as booking a doctor's appointment or figuring out what their symptoms mean. I will also be able to monitor what features would be most attractive to the user and which features they are less likely to use. Because I have already spoken with the user I will be testing, I know they are not comfortable being recorded so I will be using a pen and paper to take notes during this interview.
